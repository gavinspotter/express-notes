in this file we are going to to to import three packages:

# util 
# fs 
# uuidv1

the # util package is going to be used to promisify our read and write async function calls
the # fs package is going to be used to read write and delete our files 
the # uuidv1 package is going to be used to create a unique id that we may add the delete function to our project 

we are then going to make a class with functions for reading writing and deleting notes

finally we are going to export our class with module exports
